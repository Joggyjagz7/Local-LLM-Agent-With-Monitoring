# Local-LLM-Agent-With-Monitoring

This repository contains the `Local_RAG_Application.ipynb` notebook, which demonstrates the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application. RAG is a powerful approach that combines retrieval techniques with generative models to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers.

## Features
- **Local Setup**: Run the application on your local machine without reliance on external APIs.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Integrates a document retriever to fetch relevant information.
- **Generative Model**: Utilizes a llama2 as the base model to enhance the quality of responses.
- **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Use Arize Phoenix for monitoring and observability of the LLM
